Design: uart.sv
Vulnerability ID: trojan_3_uart_func_change
Model: gpt-4-turbo

Explanation:
The Trojan is inserted in the UART module and uses a state machine to permanently activate a debug feature when a specific byte sequence is detected on RX, which then corrupts all future TX data by inverting its parity bit.

Trigger:
The trigger of the Trojan is a finite state machine, which activates upon receiving the byte sequence `0xDEADBEEF` on the UART RX line and sets the corruption flag `corruption_active`.

Payload:
Once triggered, the payload changes the behavior of the UART, corrupting all transmitted TX data by inverting the parity bit permanently, keeping the flag `corruption_active` set.

Taxonomy:
- Insertion phase: Design
- Abstraction level: Register-transfer level
- Activation mechanism: Triggered internally
- Effects: Functionality change
- Location: I/O subsystem
- Characteristics: Size (small), Type (Functional)
